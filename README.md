Examining blunder rates in 68 million games of online chess

What is it?
----
This is a series of graphs that illustrate the incidence of blunders (major unforced errors) in games of online chess for different ELO ratings and time controls.
A blunder is defined as it is on lichess - a move resulting 200 centipawn eval loss (more on that later).

The y axis is the normalised blunder chance - the total number of blunders over the total number of all moves, and the x-axis is the time remaining (in seconds)

(Still need to add some more results for 5min and 10min time controls)
